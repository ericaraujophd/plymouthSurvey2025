This project contains the answers from a survey to Plymouth Heights CRC congregation regarding their understanding of who they are and what are their expectations for the new pastor.

The results will be analyzed using LLMs and coding in order to fill the search committee form.

The initial project contains the following documents, that should NEVER be modified:

1. church-profile-form.md contains the form to be filled and that should guide the analyzis of the responses.
2. survey-answers.csv contains the answers for a form created with the purpose of helping understanding the congregation's expectations and perceptions.

We have as a main goal in this project to provide some text analysis and data analysis over the answers in the csv document and a report that guides the filling of the church-profile-form.md document.
