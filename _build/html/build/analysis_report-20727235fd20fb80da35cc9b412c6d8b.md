## 9. Music Deeper Dive

Given the importance of worship and music, here's additional analysis:

### Current Music Satisfaction

**Question:** Does current blend of traditional/contemporary effectively meet spiritual needs?

**Common Responses:**
- "Yes" / "Good mix" / "Doing well" (majority)
- "We have a good variety"

**Specific Feedback:**

**Positive:**
- David (music director) doing great job
- Variety of instruments appreciated
- Mix of organ, piano, praise band
- Singing with music notes (not just words)

**Concerns:**
- Music too loud at beginning (for some)
- Need to learn more contemporary songs
- Want return of adult choir
- Organ: some love it, others "less organ, more piano"
- Some want more joyful, enthusiastic singing

### Music Preference by Numbers

Recall the 1-5 scale (1=traditional, 5=contemporary):
- **Only 1 person** chose fully traditional (1)
- **25%** lean traditional (2)
- **54%** want balanced (3) ← MAJORITY

## 10. Statistical Summary

### Demographics of Respondents (Based on Survey)
- 94% weekly attenders (64/68)

2. Appreciation for current ministry efforts

---

## 11. Red Flags & Cautions for Search Committee

### 1. Pastoral Turnover Impact
Multiple respondents mentioned:
- "Long-term commitment...because Pastor Ben did not show that type of commitment"
- "Should not just treat this as a job they can switch from"
- Some uncertainty about what happened with previous pastors

**Implication:** Next pastor must demonstrate clear long-term commitment. Consider asking candidates about their typical tenure and what would cause them to leave.

### 2. Staff Dynamics
Two respondents explicitly wrote: **"Getting along with staff!!!" and "Get along with staff!!!"**

**Implication:** There may be staff relationship challenges. New pastor must have strong interpersonal skills and ability to lead/collaborate with existing staff.

### 3. Denominational Divisions
The CRC relationship responses reveal real tension in the congregation about:
- Human sexuality positions
- Synodical authority
- Whether to stay in denomination

**Implication:** New pastor will need to navigate this carefully. Some want stronger traditional stance, others want more progressive approach. Pastor must be able to unite around core gospel while allowing some diversity of opinion on secondary matters.

### 4. Youth Exodus
69% identified youth retention as top challenge. Multiple comments about "younger generation moving away" and "age gaps."

**Implication:** This is not just about children's programs - it's about keeping 20s-40s engaged. If not addressed, church will age out.

### 5. Belonging Gap
29% say people are welcomed but don't integrate. This suggests:
- Existing relational cliques
- Unclear pathways to involvement
- Possible insider/outsider dynamics

**Implication:** New pastor must actively work to break down barriers and create integration opportunities.
