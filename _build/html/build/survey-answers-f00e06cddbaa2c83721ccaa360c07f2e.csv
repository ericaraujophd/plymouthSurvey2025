Again, I'm sorry for my ignorance, but I don't typically pass the sign as I go by the church throughout the week.  Would the basket ball night be an option again?  Or VBS?  ",5,"I believe our council, particularly the deacons, are responding to needs they become aware of, both inside and outside of the church membership...that's great.

The use of audio and visual technology in the service","While I appreciate and enjoy the variety of music offered during our worship services, I feel that the singing is too SLOW (I'm not shouting, just emphasizing the word ""slow"").  Even if the songs are appropriate and meaningful, the slowness/pace of praise songs/hymns can be dirge-like.  Even when the song's lyrics speak of joy and praise, the slowness of the musicians, any accompaniest and song leaders tend to drag.

I'm an older member and I enjoy singing, but I worry that the slowness of our singing is not appealing to younger members or to anyone who considers joining our church.  After church we feel that we need to apologize to visitors (college students sometimes) for the slowness of the singing.

Over the decades we have encouraged our music directors to speed up the delivery/pace of some songs, but to no avail.  Sadly, while the worship services are wonderful in most aspects, I find the slowness of the singing to be irritating and I find it neutralizes my worship experience.  I've made my attitude a matter of prayer, but I can't seem to get past it and often wonder if other members/visitors are also affected.
