LIVING FAITH:
- "We live in grateful response to God" (not works-righteousness)
- Integration of faith, work, family, citizenship
- Cultural engagement rather than withdrawal
- Justice, mercy, and compassion as expressions of faith
- "God-focused and directed" rather than human-centered

REFORMED AND REFORMING:
- "Semper reformanda" - always reforming according to Scripture
- Willingness to learn and grow in understanding
- Balance between theological rigor and pastoral warmth
- Not rigid traditionalism, but faithful continuity with historic Christianity

COMMUNITY & EDUCATION:
- Value for Christian education (schools, training, discipleship)
- Covenantal understanding of family and church
- Multi-generational faith formation
- Intellectual engagement with Scripture and theology

CHALLENGES IN LIVING IT OUT:
- Need for clearer teaching on what Reformed theology means
- "Doctrine is a lost cause at PH" (one dissenting view)
- Younger generations may not understand Reformed distinctives
- Balance between Reformed identity and contemporary accessibility
- Some see Reformed theology as background, others want it foregrounded

WHAT WE SEEK IN A PASTOR:
- Ability to teach Reformed theology clearly and compellingly
- Connect historic doctrines to contemporary life
- "Show us what it means to be Christian with Reformed perspective"
- Help younger generations appreciate and own Reformed identity
- Not merely academic but pastoral and practical

SUMMARY:
Being Reformed for us means being deeply rooted in historic Christian orthodoxy
as expressed through Reformed confessions, living out our faith in all of life
as grateful response to God's grace, and continually being reformed by the Word
of God through the Spirit's work. We want to pass this heritage to the next
generation in ways that are both faithful to our roots and relevant to our context.

### Church History

**What have been the three most important events in the history of your church?**

**[COMMITTEE MUST COMPLETE - Survey did not ask this]**

**Guidance:** Committee should consult church historical records, long-time members, and documents to identify:
1. Founding/origin story
2. Significant building projects or relocations
3. Major revivals or growth periods
4. Notable pastoral tenures
5. Defining moments of mission or identity

Survey references suggest these pastors were significant: Van Aragon, Admiraal, Sturing, and more recently Ben, Steve, Doug. Consider whether their tenures represent important historical moments.

    - Cultural negativity affecting church attitudes
    - Need for "happy place" where God's presence felt
    - "Worship should be our happy place more often than not"
    - Challenge: How to be countercultural through joy, not just opposition

PASTORAL ROLE IN NAVIGATING CHALLENGES:
The congregation looks to the new pastor to:
- Provide clear biblical teaching on cultural issues
- Model grace and truth held together
- Equip members for faithful engagement
- Help church be prophetic without being harsh
- Build resilience and hope in difficult times
- "Teach people how to live peaceably in diverse culture with opposing agendas
  and political ideologies"

We need a pastor who can help us be distinctly Christian and Reformed while
remaining winsome, engaged, and hopeful in an increasingly post-Christian culture.
